1. Why can’t a local variable be written outside the function?

Because of Scope rules
* Each function has its own local scope.
* Variables declared inside it exist only during that function’s execution.
* Once the function finishes, those variables are destroyed.
* Code outside the function cannot access or modify them.


2. Where to use map, reduce, and filter


map() – Transform data
Use when you want to apply a function to every element in a list.


filter() – Select data
Use when you want to keep only elements that satisfy a condition.


reduce() – Combine data into a single value
In Python, reduce() is from the Python Standard Library module functools.
Use when you want to reduce a list to one single result.
